Joe McLaughlin
WordCount

how did you go about starting this project?
A: I researched HashMaps and how they work.

what works and what doesnâ€™t?
A:N/A

what are the test cases you created for this assignment?
A:N/A

did these test cases help you verify the correctness of your results?
A:N/A

the surprises or problems you encountered while implementing this application
I had to put the while loop for the scanner inside of the WordCount, because if it was outside of it it would keep looking for a next until i entered a blank line, The other option would have been to put "Press enter to exit" and used that for the conditional statement in the while loop instead of hasNext()

the most important thing(s) you learned from this assignment
A:Immutable objects, autoboxing/autounboxing

what you would do differently next time?
A:I feel I did this one well.
