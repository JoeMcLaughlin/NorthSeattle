Thread assignment 


Q: How did you go about approaching this assignment?
A: I researched a bit on the java documentation about threads, and researched how to make a gui based program work with concurrent threads


Q: What works?
A: If you instantiate the ServiceDesk in the class(outside the thread's) it will be global(?) and all of the threads use the same ServiceDesk or else... view next answer...


Q: What doesn't work?
A: If you create the desk inside each thread it will create several new GUI interfaces that run only whats contained in that individual thread.


Q: How did you test your implementation? Include testing results.
A: ...


Q: What problems did you encounter as you worked on this assignment?
A: Trying to understand how to make all the threads happen in the same GUI.


Q: What did you learn from this work?
A: I learned that threads can run concurrently in the same GUI or in multiple GUI's depending on what you desire.


Q: How will you approach the next programming assignment differently?
A:
