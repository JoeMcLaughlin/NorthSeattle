Thread assignment 


Q: How did you go about approaching this assignment?
A: I researched a bit on the java documentation about threads, and researched how to make a gui based program work with concurrent threads


Q: What works?
A: If you instantiate the ServiceDesk in the class(outside the thread's) it will be global(?) and all of the threads use the same ServiceDesk or else... view next answer...


Q: What doesn't work?
A: If you create the desk inside each thread it will create several new GUI interfaces that run only whats contained in that individual thread.



Q: How did you test your implementation? Include testing results.
A: ... "Test your implementation. For this assignment, the testing can be simply running the simulation and seeing what the behavior is. There is no need to submit testing code. There really isn't any."


Q: What problems did you encounter as you worked on this assignment?
A: Trying to understand how to make all the threads happen in the same GUI.
a2( check version): I cannot figure out what it is I'm trying to do, so researching ways to help me understand is near impossible. I am trying to make one desk process one item but one item can be processed by multiple desks... how would i research information to help me... I type "Threads concurrency multiple objects in order" and things of the sort but there are so many possiblities and variants that researching feels like going down the rabbit hole. I made myself confused more than before.


Q: What did you learn from this work?
A: I learned that threads can run concurrently in the same GUI or in multiple GUI's depending on what you desire.


Q: How will you approach the next programming assignment differently?
A:
